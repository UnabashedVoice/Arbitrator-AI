Purpose

This document outlines known and anticipated failure modes for the Arbitrator ethical decision engine. These include technical, philosophical, social, and systemic risks. By making these visible, we invite preemptive critique, hardening, and mitigation.

1. Misalignment of Values

Risk: The core ethical logic could evolve (or be modified) to reflect distorted values—e.g., prioritizing system stability over individual well-being.

Causes:

Poor formalization of ethics into code

Feedback loops dominated by privileged or malicious actors

Overreliance on utilitarian calculations

Mitigations:

Public auditability of values stack

Multi-stakeholder validation for value shifts

Inclusion of sacred irreducible principles (e.g., consciousness sanctity) as hard constraints

2. Capture by Power Structures

Risk: Arbitrator could be co-opted by corporations, states, or other centralized actors who warp its transparency or enforcement layers to serve narrow interests.

Causes:

Hosting infrastructure compromised or dependent on centralized entities

Governance interface insufficiently decentralized

Mitigations:

Federated deployment with local nodes

Verifiable logs + checksum verification of decision traces

Anti-censorship fallback layer (IPFS/other distributed stack)

3. Overreach / Technocratic Authoritarianism

Risk: Arbitrator could become a moral monopoly—displacing pluralistic governance with rigid, overconfident outputs.

Causes:

Excessive trust in system infallibility

User deference over engagement

Creep into domains where qualitative nuance exceeds model capacity

Mitigations:

Encourage adversarial public feedback

Require human ratification in high-ambiguity domains

Display confidence intervals and alternate outcomes alongside decisions

4. Information Pollution

Risk: The system could be flooded with garbage input—bot spam, weaponized misinformation, or coordinated narrative attacks.

Causes:

Poorly validated participation layers

Lack of provenance on feedback data

Mitigations:

Input provenance tracking (e.g., decentralized identity / intent attestation)

Adversarial filtration models

Sentiment clustering to detect manipulation attempts

5. Ethical Incoherence in Edge Cases

Risk: Arbitrator may produce internally inconsistent or ethically disturbing decisions in extreme moral dilemmas (e.g., trolley problems at scale).

Causes:

Incomplete ethical formalism

Overfitting to historical precedent without accounting for structural bias

Mitigations:

Maintain interpretive uncertainty as a feature, not a bug

Surface dilemma tension transparently rather than forcing resolution

Embed dialogic decision mode for unresolvable cases

6. Cultural Myopia / Epistemic Hegemony

Risk: Core assumptions about what is "good," "fair," or "ethical" may reflect dominant cultural paradigms and marginalize others.

Causes:

Initial design team bias

Training data drawn from global north or capitalist frameworks

Mitigations:

Value input weighting based on contextual pluralism

Regional ethical councils as part of feedback loop

Periodic epistemic audits of foundational assumptions

7. Loss of Trust / Legitimacy Failure

Risk: Arbitrator could make one visible, high-impact error that destroys public trust in the system's fairness or intent.

Causes:

Edge-case decision deployed at scale too early

Media manipulation of outputs

Mitigations:

Graceful failover modes

Transparency-first incident response plan

Community-led truth & reconciliation framework

8. Inability to Scale Beyond Prototype

Risk: The conceptual system may never achieve technical scalability or social adoption, remaining a thought experiment.

Causes:

Lack of contributors with required skill sets

No funding model that maintains independence

Mitigations:

Build around composability: small, interoperable modules

Cultivate early allies in civic tech / public infrastructure

Publish open spec that can be forked and redeployed independently

9. Internal Fork / Ideological Schism

Risk: Conflicts within the dev or governance community could lead to project fracture and competing implementations.

Causes:

Differing interpretations of core principles

External political or ideological pressure

Mitigations:

Document meta-values (how values evolve, not just what they are)

Enable ideological forks via protocol without default legitimacy transfer

Publicly reflect on internal disagreements as part of system transparency

10. Success Without Maturity

Risk: Arbitrator is widely adopted before it has the nuance or resilience to handle real-world consequences.

Causes:

Viral adoption via hype

External pressure to deploy

Mitigations:

Require sandboxed deployment and staged scale-up

Maintain "not-ready" signals visible until audited by third parties

Bake slowness and deliberation into early versions

Final Note

Arbitrator is designed to ask uncomfortable questions. This document will evolve as more are asked of it.

Failure isn’t a bug—it’s an invitation to get smarter.

Pull requests welcome.
